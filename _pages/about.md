Hi! I am a third-year PhD at Monash University Malaysia, working on research in **generative ML for time-series data**. Outside of research, I like to play piano and eat good food. 

I am currently a member of the [MedAI-Hub](https://sites.google.com/monash.edu/medai-hub), where I develop **generative ML frameworks** for **brain signal analysis**, with a focus on signal-processing perspectives for time-series modeling. 

My research centers on generative modeling in signal-processing domains for time-series applications. To date, I have authored two first-author papers in top-tier venues (ICLR and IEEE TII), along with additional publications in conferences such as MICCAI, ICASSP and etc. One manuscript is currently under review. 

I am actively seeking visiting PhD opportunities. If you are working on or interested in generative modeling, time-series analysis, or brain signal research, I would be happy to connect!
